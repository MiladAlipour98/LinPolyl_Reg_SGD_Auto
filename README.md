Implementation and Comparison of Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent and Matrix Formula: A Case Study on the Auto Dataset
Project involves implementing linear regression and polynomial regression. The learning of parameters is performed using both the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm and the direct matrix formula. The study focuses on the Auto Dataset, which consists of 397 samples and 9 features related to various aspects of vehicles.
